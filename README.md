It is a simple game that you can play in your free time.


*Rules:
       
       -Every time you start the game by pressing any key a random box flashes
       
       -You tap the save box that was flashed
       
       -If u did it correctly the screen flashes green indicating level cleared
       
       -In the next level you another box flashes but now you need to remember
       the sequence you clicked in the same order and click the newly flashed 
       box and if it flashes Green , Voila!! But if it flashes RED no issue try 
       again.
       - And yaahh dont forget to enjoy.
